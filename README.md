# 🌊 Water Quality - Project Week 1

This is my AICTE Skills4Future Internship-Edunet Foundation project and here I have done the analysis of water quality data and done some basic data cleaning and visualization using Python.

📁 Project Overview

Dataset: water_quality. csv

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Searborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Objective: To understand dataset, clean missing values and generate a heatmap of how each feature is correlated.

📌 Tasks Completed

Imported the water quality data

Removed rows with missing values

Created a correlation heatmap with seaborn And much more.

Shape of the printed dataset - Null count printed below the shape

🧪 Technologies Used

pandas for data handling

matplotlib. pyplot and seaborn for charting

scikit-learn and scipy to use in upcoming exercises

📸 Sample Output

Heatmap of Feature Correlation:

Plots a color-encoded map of the correlation of numerical fields in the dataset in the “coolwarm” color map.

📂 File Info

| File Name   | Description |
