## 📅 Week 1 – Potability Classification

In this project, I analyzed the water quality dataset and applied basic data cleaning and visualization techniques using Python.

📁 Dataset: water_quality.csv  
🎯 Objective: Understand the dataset, clean missing values, and visualize feature relationships using a heatmap.

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Imported and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Generated a correlation heatmap using seaborn
- Printed dataset shape and null counts

### 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, Scipy

### 📸 Sample Output
Heatmap showing the correlation of numerical features using a "coolwarm" colormap.

## 📅 Week 2 – Multi-Output Regression

In Week 2, the objective was to predict multiple target features using a multi-output regression model.

📁 Dataset: PB_ALL_2000_2021.csv  
🎯 Objective: Use MultiOutputRegressor with Random Forest to predict multiple water quality indicators.

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Loaded and cleaned the multi-year dataset
- Applied train-test split
- Trained a MultiOutputRegressor model using RandomForestRegressor
- Evaluated results using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
